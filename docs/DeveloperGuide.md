## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteProperty 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

### General class diagram

<puml src="diagrams/GeneralClassDiagram.puml" width="850" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteClient 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteClientCommand.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteClient 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCientCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteClientCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores `Property` objects within each `Person` (as a `Set<Property>`), and maintains a separate flattened `ObservableList<Property>` across all persons, exposed as a filtered and sorted list for the UI.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list and a `Property` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag and one `Property` object per unique property, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` and `Property` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Client feature

The `addClient` feature allows users to add a new client to the address book.

The `AddClientCommand` is executed through the following flow:

1. The command checks whether the client to be added already exists using `Model#hasPerson(toAdd)`.
2. If the client does not already exist, the command calls `Model#addPerson(toAdd)` to add the client.
3. `ModelManager` updates the underlying `AddressBook`.
4. The command returns a `CommandResult`.

For simplicity, the sequence diagram below focuses on the main interactions involved in adding the client and omits lower-level validation details such as exception handling for duplicate clients.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

<puml src="diagrams/AddClientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddClient sequence diagram" />

### Add Property feature

The `addProperty` feature allows users to add a property to a client identified by the index in the displayed client list.

The `AddPropertyCommand` is executed through the following flow:

1. The command retrieves the currently displayed client list using `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
2. The target client is identified using the provided index.
3. The command validates whether the property can be added to the target client.
4. A new `Person` object is created with the new property added.
5. The command calls `Model#setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson)` to update the client.
6. `ModelManager` updates the underlying `AddressBook`.
7. The command returns a `CommandResult`.

For simplicity, the sequence diagram below focuses on the main interactions and omits lower-level validation details, including `Person` object creation, which will also be omitted in the sequence diagrams of all other features as the process is detailed in the `addClient` feature.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

<puml src="diagrams/AddPropertySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddProperty sequence diagram" />

### Edit Client feature

The `editClient` feature allows users to update the details of an existing client identified by an index in the displayed client list.

The `EditClientCommand` is executed through the following flow:

1. The command retrieves the currently displayed client list using `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
2. The target client is identified using the provided index.
3. A new `Person` object is created with the updated fields.
4. The command calls `Model#setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson)` to update the client.
5. `ModelManager` updates the underlying `AddressBook`.
6. The command returns a `CommandResult`.

If one or more `t/` prefixes are provided, the client’s existing tags are replaced. If `t/` is provided without a value, all existing tags are cleared.

For simplicity, the sequence diagram below focuses on the main interactions involved in updating the client and omits lower-level details such as index checks, exception handling and `Person` object creation.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

<puml src="diagrams/EditClientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditClient sequence diagram" />

### Edit Property feature

The `editProperty` feature allows users to edit an existing property identified by its index in the displayed property list.

The `EditPropertyCommand` is executed through the following flow:

1. The command retrieves the currently displayed property list using `Model#getFilteredPropertyList()`.
2. The target property is identified using the provided index.
3. The command identifies the client who owns the target property.
4. The property is updated through its owner.
5. A new `Person` object is created with the updated property.
6. The command calls `Model#setPerson(owner, editedPerson)` to update the client.
7. `ModelManager` updates the underlying `AddressBook`.
8. The command returns a `CommandResult`.

Only the specified fields are updated. All other fields remain unchanged.

For simplicity, the sequence diagram below focuses on the main interactions involved in editing a property and omits lower-level details such as index checks, exception handling and `Person` object creation.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

<puml src="diagrams/EditPropertySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditProperty sequence diagram" />

### Delete Client feature

The delete client feature allows users to delete a client identified by the index in the displayed property list.
This is done by validating the client deletion, deleting the properties linked with the client(if any) and updating client list in the addressbook

The `DeleteClientCommand` is executed through the following flow:
1. `DeleteClientCommand` retrieves the currently displayed client list by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
2. The target client is identified using the provided index.
3. `DeleteClientCommand` validates that the indexed target client exists
4. `DeleteClientCommand` then calls Person#getProperties() to get the list of properties owned by the target client
5. If the target client has properties listed, the command will execute the `DeletePropertyCommand` on the target clients properties until the target client has no more properties listed
6. Then, `DeleteClientCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` again to get the updated client list after all the properties linked to the target client has been deleted.
7. The target client is retrieved from the new updated list and then removed from the list
8. `DeleteClientCommand` returns a CommandResult after the target client have been removed from the list

For simplicity, the sequence diagram focuses on the main interactions involved in checking if the client has properties
and deleting the properties if any. Then finally removing the target client from the list.
Low-level validation details such as exception handling is omitted.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteClientCommand.puml" alt="Interactions between DeleteClientCommand and ModelManager for list updates" />

### Delete Property feature

The delete property feature allows users to delete a property identified by the index in the displayed property list.
This is done by validating the property deletion and updating the target client in the address book.

The `DeletePropertyCommand` is executed through the following flow:
1. The command retrieves the currently displayed property list by calling `Model#getFilteredPropertyList()`.
2. The target property is identified using the provided index.
3. The command validates whether the property can be deleted from the target client.
4. If the property deletion is valid, `DeletePropertyCommand` creates an updated `Person` object without the deleted property.
5. `DeletePropertyCommand` calls `Model#setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson)`.
6. `ModelManager#setPerson(...)` updates the target client in the underlying `AddressBook`.
7. The command returns a `CommandResult` after the target client has been updated.

For simplicity, the sequence diagram below focuses on the main interactions involved in updating the target client and
omits lower-level details such as index checks, ownership checks, exception handling and `Person` object creation.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

>>>>>>> master

### Filter Client feature
The filterClient feature allows users to filter the client list by name keywords, tag keywords, or both, and automatically shows only the properties belonging to those filtered clients. This is done by updating the predicates on the FilteredList objects.

The `FilterClientCommand` is executed through the following flow:

1. The command is executed with a client predicate (`PersonMatchesFilterPredicate`) built from the user input, which may include name keywords, tag keywords, or both. 
2. `FilterClientCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`. 
3. `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(...)` updates the person `FilteredList` by calling `setPredicate(...)`.
4. `FilterClientCommand` then calls `Model#updateFilteredPropertyList(predicate)`.
5. `ModelManager#updateFilteredPropertyList(...)` updates the property `FilteredList` to show only properties belonging to the filtered clients.
6. The command returns a `CommandResult` after both filtered lists have been updated.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterClientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions between FilterClientCommand and ModelManager for filtered list updates" />

#### Design Highlights

* **Multi-criteria Filtering**: The `PersonMatchesFilterPredicate` implements the `Predicate<Person>` interface and supports filtering by name keywords and tag keywords simultaneously.
* **Name Keyword Matching**: The predicate performs case-insensitive word matching on the client's name using `StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase()`. Multiple name keywords use OR logic — a client matches if their name contains any of the specified keywords.
* **Tag Keyword Matching**: The predicate performs case-insensitive exact matching on the client's tags. Multiple tag keywords use OR logic — a client matches if they have any of the specified tags.
* **AND Logic Between Criteria**: When both name and tag keywords are provided, a client must satisfy both conditions simultaneously to be included in the results.
* **Cascading Filter**: After filtering clients, the command automatically updates the property list to show only properties belonging to those clients, providing a complete view of relevant data.
* **Flexible Criteria**: At least one filter criterion (name or tag keywords) must be provided, but both can be combined.

### Filter Property feature

The filter property feature allows users to filter properties by address keywords, type keywords, price range, and size range, and automatically display the owners of those properties. This is done by updating the predicates on the `FilteredList` objects.

The `FilterPropertyCommand` is executed through the following flow:

1. The command is executed with a property predicate (`PropertyMatchesFilterPredicate`) built from the user input, which may include address keywords, type keywords, price range, and/or size range.
2. `FilterPropertyCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredPropertyList(predicate)`.
3. `ModelManager#updateFilteredPropertyList(...)` updates the property `FilteredList` by calling `setPredicate(...)`.
4. `FilterPropertyCommand` then calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
5. `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(...)` updates the person `FilteredList` by calling `setPredicate(ownersOfFilteredProperties)`.
6. The command returns a `CommandResult` after both filtered lists have been updated.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterPropertySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions between FilterPropertyCommand and ModelManager for filtered list updates" />

#### Design Highlights

* **Multi-criteria Filtering**: The `PropertyMatchesFilterPredicate` implements the `Predicate<Property>` interface and supports filtering by address keywords, type keywords, price range, and size range simultaneously.
* **Address Keyword Matching**: The predicate supports multiple address keywords and performs case-insensitive matching using `StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase()`. Keywords use OR logic (properties matching any keyword are included).
* **Type Keyword Matching**: The predicate supports optional type keywords and also performs case-insensitive matching.
* **Numeric Range Filtering**: The predicate supports optional minimum and maximum price and size boundaries. A property must fall within all specified ranges to match.
* **Cascading Filter**: After filtering properties, the command automatically updates the person list to show only those who own matching properties, providing a complete view of relevant data.
* **Flexible Criteria**: At least one filter criterion (address keywords, type keywords, price range, or size range) must be provided, but users can combine any of these filters as needed.

### Sort Property feature

The sortProperty feature allows users to sort the currently displayed property list by price or size in ascending or descending order. This is done by applying a Comparator<Property> to the SortedList<Property>.

The `SortPropertyCommand` is executed through the following flow:

1. `SortPropertyCommand` constructs a `Comparator<Property>` based on the specified sortType — either "price" or "size".
2. If the specified order is "down", the comparator is reversed.
3. `SortPropertyCommand` calls `Model#sortPropertyList(comparator)`.
4. `ModelManager#sortPropertyList(...)` calls `setComparator(comparator)` on the underlying `SortedList<Property>`.
5. The sorted list immediately reflects the new order.
6. The command returns a `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions:

<puml src="diagrams/SortPropertySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortProperty sequence diagram" />

#### Design Highlights

* **Layered List Architecture**: Properties are stored in a `SortedList<Property>` wrapping a `FilteredList<Property>`. Sort and filter operations are independent and can be applied simultaneously without conflict.
* **Numeric Comparison**: The comparator parses `Price.value` or `Size.value` string fields to Long before comparing, ensuring correct numeric ordering rather than lexicographic ordering.
* **Persistent Sort State**: The sort order persists until another sortProperty command is issued or the application is restarted, allowing users to browse sorted results freely.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `deleteClient 5` command to delete the 5th client in the address book. The `deleteClient` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `deleteClient 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `addClient n/David …` to add a new client. The `addClient` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.

  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

#### Proposed Implementation

The data archiving feature would allow property agents to move completed transactions (sold properties and their associated clients) to an archive, keeping the active address book focused on current listings and active clients. This improves performance and organization as the address book grows over time.

The archiving mechanism would be facilitated by an `ArchiveManager` component that handles the movement of data between the active address book and an archive storage. The archive would be stored separately from the main data file to prevent accidental modification of historical records.

**Key Components:**

* **`ArchiveManager`** - Handles archiving operations and maintains archive data integrity
* **`ArchiveStorage`** - Manages persistence of archived data in JSON format
* **`ArchiveCommand`** - User command to archive completed transactions
* **`ArchiveListCommand`** - Command to view archived data
* **`UnarchiveCommand`** - Command to restore archived data if needed

**Archive Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "archivedClients": [
    {
      "client": {...},
      "properties": [...],
      "archiveDate": "2024-12-01",
      "archiveReason": "Property sold"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Implementation Details

1. **Archiving Process:**
   - User identifies a property that has been sold using `archiveProperty INDEX reason/REASON`
   - System validates the property exists and belongs to a client
   - System moves the property and its associated client to the archive
   - System removes the property from the active address book
   - If the client has no remaining properties, the client is also archived

2. **Archive Storage:**
   - Archived data is stored in a separate JSON file (`archive.json`)
   - Archive file is automatically created if it doesn't exist
   - Data is encrypted if sensitive information is stored

3. **Viewing Archived Data:**
   - `listArchive` command displays archived clients and properties
   - `viewArchive INDEX` shows detailed information of archived entries
   - Archived data is read-only to prevent accidental modification

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Archive vs Delete**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Archive completed transactions
  * Pros: Preserves historical data for reference, maintains data integrity, allows restoration if needed
  * Cons: Increases storage requirements, adds complexity to data management

* **Alternative 2:** Permanently delete completed transactions
  * Pros: Simpler implementation, reduces storage needs, cleaner active data
  * Cons: Loss of historical data, cannot recover accidentally deleted information

**Aspect: Archive Triggers**

* **Alternative 1:** Manual archiving by user command
  * Pros: User has full control over what gets archived, prevents accidental archiving
  * Cons: Requires user action, may lead to cluttered active data if forgotten

* **Alternative 2:** Automatic archiving based on criteria (e.g., property marked as "sold")
  * Pros: Automatic cleanup, ensures old data doesn't accumulate
  * Cons: Risk of premature archiving, less user control

**Aspect: Archive Accessibility**

* **Alternative 1:** Archive data remains searchable and viewable
  * Pros: Easy reference to historical data, maintains full functionality
  * Cons: Slightly more complex implementation

* **Alternative 2:** Archive data is compressed and offline
  * Pros: Better performance, reduced storage impact
  * Cons: Historical data harder to access, requires restoration process

#### Benefits

* **Performance:** Active address book remains focused on current clients and properties
* **Organization:** Clear separation between active and historical data
* **Data Integrity:** Historical records are preserved and protected from accidental modification
* **Compliance:** Maintains audit trail for business records
* **Scalability:** Prevents the address book from becoming unwieldy as business grows

#### Potential Extensions

* **Archive Search:** Allow searching within archived data
* **Archive Reports:** Generate reports from archived transaction data
* **Bulk Archive:** Archive multiple properties at once
* **Archive Categories:** Categorize archives (e.g., by year, by property type)
* **Archive Backup:** Automated backup of archive data to external storage

* tech-savvy property agents
* types fast
* comfortable using CLI apps

### Value Proposition:

ClientVault enables Singapore residential property agents to capture, organize, and retrieve client + property details in seconds through a fast, keyboard-driven interface. This reduces the friction of searching across chat logs and spreadsheets when handling daily tasks such as:

* managing client contacts and roles (buyer/seller)
* recalling unit details (flat type / size / bedrooms / lease remaining)
* tracking buyer requirements (budget, location, preferred property type)
* quickly matching buyers to suitable seller listings.

<box type="note" seamless>

**Note:**

- Edit Property works the same way, with the following differences:
  - In step 2, the actor uses the property index and the fields to update (address, price, size, type) instead of client index and client fields
  - In extension 4b, the system will additionally check that the client will not have 2 HDB type properties after the edit on top of checking for duplicate property entry
    </box>

      Use case resumes from step 3

* 3a. No clients match the keywords
    * 3a1. System shows message that no clients match the criteria
    
      Use case ends

<box type="note" seamless>

**Note:**

- Filter Property works the same way, with the following differences:
    - In step 1, the actor can filter by property address, property type, price range, or size range instead of client name and tag fields
      </box>

**Use Case 8: Sort Property**

Goal: Sort properties by price or size to quickly find the most suitable property for a client

**MSS:**
1. Actor enters sort criteria (price or size) with appropriate parameter (up or down)
2. Actor uses the sortProperty feature with the criteria and parameter
3. System sorts the property list according to the criteria and parameter
4. System displays the sorted list of properties

   Use case ends

**Extensions:**
* 2a. Invalid sort criteria or parameter provided (e.g., criteria other than price or size, parameter other than up or down)
    * 2a1. System shows error message that the sort criteria or parameter is invalid
    
      Step 2a1 repeats until Actor provides valid sort criteria and parameter
    
      Use case resumes from step 3

**Use Case 9: Exit Application**

Goal: Exit the application

**MSS:**
1. Actor uses the exit command
2. System saves the address book data and user preferences to files
3. System exits

   Use case ends

2. The system should be able to manage at least 1000 client records without noticeable degradation in performance during typical usage.
3. A user with above-average typing speed for regular English text should be able to complete most tasks faster using keyboard commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should respond to any valid user command within 2 seconds under normal operating conditions.
5. Error messages should be clear and guide the user towards corrective action.
6. The application should be packaged as a single executable JAR file.
7. User data should be stored locally and not transmitted externally without user consent.
8. The application should have a user-friendly command syntax that is consistent across different features.

### Glossary

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements** ##
Team size: 5

1. **Empty descriptor error message**: Make the error message for empty descriptors more specific. Currently, when a user types a command with an empty descriptor (e.g., `addClient n/`), the error message is `Invalid command format!`. We plan to update this to: `The [FIELD] field cannot be empty. Please provide a value for [FIELD].` This will help users understand exactly which field is missing and how to correct it. For example, if the user types `addClient n/`, the error message would be: `The name field cannot be empty. Please provide a value for name.` This enhancement will be applied to all relevant fields across both clients and properties (e.g., address, price, size, etc.). Additionally, we can consider adding examples of valid input formats in the error message to further guide users (e.g., `Please provide a value for name. Example: n/John Doe`).
2. **Duplicate client error message**: Make the error message for adding a duplicate client more specific. Currently, attempting to add a client with an identical name produces the generic message `This person already exists in the address book.` We plan to update this to: `A client with the name [NAME] already exists`. If this is a different person, consider using a distinguishing middle name or suffix (e.g., `Alice Tan 2`). This update includes duplicate checking for phone number and email address, which should have their own specific error messages as well.
3. **Duplicate property error message**: When adding a property that already exists in the address book, the error message should specify which existing property has that address. For example: `A property with the address [ADDRESS] already exists, owned by client [NAME].`
4. **Out-of-range error message**: Make the error message for out-of-range index more descriptive. When a user types a command like `deleteProperty 99` and there are fewer than 99 contacts, the current error message is `Invalid property index!` We plan to improve this to: `Index 99 is out of range. The current list has [N] properties. Please enter an index between 1 and [N].`
5. **Improve the edit command output**: Make successful editClient show what was actually changed. Currently, a successful edit command returns `Edited Person: [all fields]`, which makes it hard to see what changed. We plan to update the success message to show only the fields that were modified: e.g., `Edited contact Alex Yeoh: phone updated from 91234567 to 98765432.` This can be extended to editProperty as well, e.g., `Edited property 1: price updated from $500,000 to $550,000.`
6. **Strengthen client details validation**: Currently, the validation of client details is that `p/Phone` must be 8 digits and `e/Email` must contain an `@` symbol. We plan to enhance this validation to ensure that the phone number starts with 6, 8, or 9, and that the email has a valid format (e.g., contains a valid domain name after the `@` symbol).
7. **Shortcuts for command name**: Implement shortcuts for command names to allow faster typing. For example, `addClient` can be shortened to `ac`, `deleteProperty` can be shortened to `dp`, etc. This would require updating the parser to recognise these shortcuts and map them to the full command names.
8. **Tag support**: Increase the characters allowed for tags to include spaces and special characters, allowing for more descriptive tags (e.g., `t/follow-up`, `t/hot lead`, `t/VIP_client`). Furthermore, we can improve the UI support for tags by ensuring they can render properly with spaces and special characters, and limiting the number of tags displayed in the client card to prevent clutter (e.g., show only the first 3 tags and indicate if there are more).
9. **Limit parameter length**: Currently, some paramter such as `name`, `address`, `email`, and `remark` can be very long, which can cause issues in the UI and storage. We plan to set reasonable maximum lengths for these parameters (e.g., name: 50 characters, address: 100 characters, email: 50 characters, remark: 200 characters) and update the validation logic to enforce these limits. The error messages should also specify the maximum allowed length when a user exceeds it.
10. **Incorrectly cased command error message**: When a user types a command with incorrect casing (e.g., `AddClient` instead of `addClient`), the current error message is `Unknown command!`. We plan to improve this by checking for case-insensitive matches and suggesting the correct command. For example, if the user types `AddClient`, the error message could be: `Unknown command "AddClient". Did you mean "addClient"?`

 
## **Appendix: Effort** ##

### Difficulty Level

ClientVault is significantly more complex than AB3. AB3 manages a single entity type (`Person`) with a flat, uniform set of fields. ClientVault introduces **two distinct entities** — clients and properties — each with their own domain-specific fields, validation rules, and UI representations. On top of this, we implemented a **linking mechanism** between clients and properties, which required bidirectional relationship management across the model, storage, and UI layers. The overall difficulty is estimated to be roughly **1.5–2× that of AB3**.

### Challenges Faced

**Managing two entity types.** Extending AB3's single-entity model to support both `Client` and `Property` required significant refactoring of the `Model`, `Logic`, and `Storage` components. Commands that previously operated uniformly on `Person` objects needed to be duplicated and specialised, and parsers had to distinguish between the two entity types at the command level.

**Domain-specific field validation.** Property-specific fields such as property size, type, and price required thoughtful constraints. Determining sensible validation bounds and producing meaningful error messages for each field added a non-trivial amount of implementation and testing effort compared to AB3's simpler `Name`, `Phone`, and `Email` fields.

**UI adaptation.** The default AB3 UI displays a single uniform contact list. We adapted this to differentiate clients from properties visually and to display linked contacts within each card, requiring non-trivial changes to the FXML layout and the `PersonCard` / `PersonListPanel` components.

### Effort Required

Compared to AB3's approximately 6 KLoC of functional code, ClientVault's codebase is meaningfully larger due to the addition of new entity types, new commands, extended parser logic, and the linking feature. We estimate the team put in roughly **300–400 hours** of combined effort across the second half of the semester, roughly distributed as: model/logic refactoring (~30%), new commands and parsers (~25%), storage and data integrity (~15%), UI changes (~15%), testing (~15%).

### Reuse and Adaptation

A significant portion of the project's scaffolding was inherited from **AB3**, including the overall architecture (UI → Logic → Model → Storage), the `Command`/`Parser` framework, JSON serialisation via Jackson, and the JavaFX UI shell. This saved roughly **20–25%** of the effort that would have been required to build from scratch. Our work focused on adapting and extending this base rather than replacing it.

No external libraries beyond those already present in AB3 (`Jackson`, `JavaFX`, `JUnit 5`) were introduced.

### Achievements

- Successfully extended a single-entity address book into a **dual-entity property agent tool** with domain-relevant fields.
- Implemented a **bidirectional client–property linking system** with referential integrity maintained across edits, deletions, and storage serialisation.
- Achieved good test coverage across new commands and model classes, maintaining the project's overall code quality bar.
- Delivered a coherent, property-agent-focused CLI experience that meaningfully differentiates ClientVault from the AB3 baseline.
